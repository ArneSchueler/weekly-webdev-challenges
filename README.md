# Weekly-webdev-challenges
This repository contains a series of weekly web development challenges.
Each exercise focuses on a specific topic — starting with HTML structure and semantics, then moving on to CSS styling and JavaScript interactivity.

The goal is to encourage consistent practice, creativity, and clean coding habits.

### Each week includes:

- A clear task description

- Rules and optional goals

- A focus on building real-world web development skills
